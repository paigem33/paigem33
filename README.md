## Hi, I'm Paige! :vulcan_salute:

I am a recent Computer Science graduate from Utah State University, and I am currently working as a .Net Developer. I am based in Northern Utah, USA. \
I have been working and studying in the tech world since 2019, and I have loved (almost) every second of it! I enjoy having the opprotunity to learn new skills and solve new problems everyday, one line of code at a time.  

When I'm not at my computer you can find me hanging out with my cat, watching tv, hiking with my dog, rock climbing (poorly), camping, or sewing.  

### Some of my favorites :woman_technologist:
